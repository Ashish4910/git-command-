Nifty==> 22469

if nifty cross 22526 i need to sell the put 
if nifty open between 22460 to 224400 then after one hour i will sell the call 
note==> I'm mostly likly way toward the selling call position because its all time high but its risky

BankNifty ==>47558

1. BankNifty is in up-trend
2. Banknifty open above 47560 and continue to move up the look at the rejection point 48000
3.if its open at 47400 our below the wait and mark some point of current market and sell the put

note ==> im bullish in banknifty because its in upmove toward reaching the biggest rejection 48000
